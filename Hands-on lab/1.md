# Exercise 1: Setting up Azure Migrate

Duration: 10 minutes

Azure Migrate provides a centralized hub to assess and migrate on-premises servers, infrastructure, applications, and data to Azure . It provides a single portal to start, run, and track your migration to Azure. Azure Migrate comes with a range of tools for assessment and migration that we will use during our lab. We will use Azure Migrate as the central location for our assessment and migration efforts.
